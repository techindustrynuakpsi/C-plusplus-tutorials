## 1. 
Let's say you have some number of each of the strings `zero, 'one`, `two`, `three`, `four`, `five`, `six`, `seven`, `eight`, and `nine`. 
The letters from each of those words are mixed up into a bag. How do you determine how many of each strings there are? Write a Function using C++.

## 2. 
If you used recursion for question 1, redo question 1 with a for/while loop. If you used for/while loop in question 1, redo question 1 with a recursive loop.

## 4.
Say you have a project you are working on, and you need to be able to use the function with different inputs. These inputs may not have the same data type. Make a function that swaps the two inputs to the function.
